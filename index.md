## Portfolio of CPSC120L Labs

Lab 5 part 1 

This lab was good that calculating something works well on the code. Figuring out a good way to make proper code was a bit of a struggle but it was fun when it worked well. 

 

Lab 12 

It was fun to use color gradations moving many ways and make patterns of them. The visual output was fascinating. 

 

Lab 8 

Making proper sandwich ingredients was fun when putting anything on the sandwich. I can learn more about codes in many ways.
